### Any Boolean function, it doesn't really matter on how many variables and what the boolean function is, can be represented in an expression using only the operations AND, OR, and NOT.

## NAND

(x NAND y) = NOT(x AND y)

| X | Y | NAND |
| --- |:---:| ---:|
| 0 | 0 | 1 |
| 0 | 1 | 1 |
| 1 | 0| 1 | 
| 1 | 1| 0 |

### If you have only NOT and AND you can prove every boolean expression

### NOT + AND = NAND
